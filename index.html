        <div class='ii-subheading'> Contacting me </div>

        You have many options for getting in touch with me and I encourage you to use one or more of them:
        <ul>
          <li> the Student Learning Portal (SLP), using the Messaging tab </li>
          <li> Email, using the address above </li>
          <li> Google Voice - the number I listed above is just for my students.  
               You can leave a voice mail or you can text the number. </li>
          <li>  "Live Chat" - using Blackboard Collaborate I hold office hours a couple of times per week and also by appointment (see the notice below for details).  Click on the <b><i>Live Chat</i></b> link in the 
				navigation menu to try it out. If another tool like Skype or Google Hangouts would work better for you, just let me know.

        </ul>

          <div class='ii-subheading'> Some of my background </div>
          After an enjoyable and rewarding career in software development I went back to school and became 
          a teacher.  I taught high school math and computer science for ten years, covering most of the high 
          school curriculum from Algebra 1 and Intro to Java through AP Calc, Stats, and Computer Science. 
        </p>
		
        <p>I became a full time online teacher in Jan 2017. 
          While it's probably obvious I like math and technology, I have other passions too.  I love to read -
          fiction of all kinds. I like to cook and enjoy all kinds of food. I'm married and have a young adult 
          son.  My family enjoys bicycling, hiking, and spending time in the Upper Peninsula.
